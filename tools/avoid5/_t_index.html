<h1>AVoid 5</h1>
<p>This WWW application allows you to form writing without
using a fifthglyph, that symbol amid "D" and "F" (or "W" and "R" on
most typing boards). Put writing into that box down from this writing and
this app will find all fifthglyphs and notify you about said glyphs,
and find ways of taking out said glyphs. </p>
